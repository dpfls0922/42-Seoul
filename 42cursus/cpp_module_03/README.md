# C++ - Module 03

## Exercise 00: Aaaaand... OPEN!

```
Exercise : 00
Aaaaand... OPEN!
Turn-in directory : ex00/
Files to turn in : ClapTrap.cpp ClapTrap.hpp main.cpp
Forbidden functions : None
```

First, you have to implement a class! How original!
It will be called ClapTrap and will have the following private attributes initialized to the values specified in brackets:
- Name, which is passed as parameter to a constructor
- Hit points (10), represent the health of the ClapTrap
- Energy points (10)
- Attack damage (0)

Add the following public member functions so the ClapTrap looks more realistic:
- void attack(const std::string& target);
- void takeDamage(unsigned int amount);
- void beRepaired(unsigned int amount);

When ClapTrack attacks, it causes its target to lose <attack damage>
hit points. When ClapTrap repairs itself, it gets <amount> hit points back. Attacking and repairing cost 1 energy point each. Of course, ClapTrap can’t do anything if it has no hit points or energy points left.

In all of these member functions, you have to print a message to describe what happens. For example, the attack() function may display something like (of course, without
the angle brackets):

    ClapTrap <name> attacks <target>, causing <damage> points of damage!

The constructors and destructor must also display a message, so your peer-evaluators
can easily see they have been called.
Implement and turn in your own tests to ensure your code works as expected.

## Exercise 01: Serena, my love!

```
Exercise : 01
Serena, my love!
Turn-in directory : ex01/
Files to turn in : Same as previous exercise + ScavTrap.cpp ScavTrap.hpp
Forbidden functions : None
```

Because you can never have enough ClapTraps, you will now create a derived robot.
It will be named ScavTrap and will inherit the constructors and destructor from ClapTrap. However, its constructors, destructor and attack() will print different messages.
After all, ClapTraps are aware of their individuality.

Note that proper construction/destruction chaining must be shown in your tests.
When a ScavTrap is created, the program starts by building a ClapTrap. Destruction is in reverse order. Why?

ScavTrap will use the attributes of ClapTrap (update ClapTrap in consequence) and
must initialize them to:
- Name, which is passed as parameter to a constructor
- Hit points (100), represent the health of the ClapTrap
- Energy points (50)
- Attack damage (20)
ScavTrap will also have its own special capacity:
- void guardGate();

This member function will display a message informing that ScavTrap is now in Gate keeper mode.
Don’t forget to add more tests to your program.

## Exercise 02: Repetitive work

```
Exercise : 02
Repetitive work
Turn-in directory : ex02/
Files to turn in : Same as previous exercise + TragTrap.cpp TragTrap.hpp
Forbidden functions : None
```

Making ClapTraps is probably starting to get on your nerves.
Now, implement a FragTrap class that inherits from ClapTrap. It is very similar to ScavTrap. However, its construction and destruction messages must be different. Proper construction/destruction chaining must be shown in your tests. When a FragTrap is created, the program starts by building a ClapTrap. Destruction is in reverse order.

Same things for the attributes, but with different values this time:
- Name, which is passed as parameter to a constructor
- Hit points (100), represent the health of the ClapTrap
- Energy points (100)
- Attack damage (30)
FragTrap has a special capacity too:
- void highFivesGuys(void);
This member function displays a positive high fives request on the standard output.
Again, add more tests to your program.
